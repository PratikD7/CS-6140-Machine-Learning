1.)
The addition of new features reduces the RMSE for both the dataset upto a certain point and then
it increases as shown in the plots.
RMSE is lowest for P=3 for YATCH and p=5 for SINUSOID

Yes, for both the datasets, training and validation RMSE follows a similar curve as shown in the plots.

2.)
We can always include more higher order polynomial features in the dataset. We can find the optimal
value of polynomial by comparing the results and selecting the model with least RMSE.

Cross-terms between features are quite useful when there is a relationship/dependency between
two or more features in the dataset.
Ex: Length, Breadth of a room are 2 of the features of a dataset housing to calculate the price of the house.
Croos terms could include a new feature with (length*breadth) value (i.e area)

This is certainly not an efficient approach because it takes a lot of time to find the optimal value of
polynomial and prior knowledge about features for cross-terms.
But once we get the above two optimal values, our model's performance drastically increases.
