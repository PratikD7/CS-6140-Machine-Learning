I used trial and error to choose the optimal values of 'number of iterations' and 'tolerance'.
I compared my results to the Python's library of sklearn's logistic regression.
I kept changing my parameter values till I got close enough to sklearn's accuracy.

The graphs for various values are plotted in the pdf 1.3.3.pdf.
