For KMeans, the distance metric we used to calculate the SSE was the Euclidean distance. It makes sense to use Euclidean distance as the area of influence
of a kmeans centroid is spherical.

But for GMM the area of influence is not necessarily spherical, so the Euclidean distance might not work well.
Kmeans is a special case of GMM that assumes
i) Hard assignment of data points
ii) Identity matrix as a covariance matrix

If we use arbritary covariance matrix the exponent term will be, −(1/2)(x−μ).T (Σ−1)(x−μ).
The above term is similar to the 'Mahalanobis' distance.
It is defined as :
    Dm(x) = sqrt ((x-u).T (S.inv) (x-u))
    where x is set of observations, u is set of means and S is a covariance matrix.

So the "'Mahalanobis' distance" is a better estimate for a distance matrix for GMM.
