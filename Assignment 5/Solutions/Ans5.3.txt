K Means is sensitive to initialization parameters.
Finding optimal starting centroids for KMeans is a NP_Hard problem.
So we need Heuristics for that. One simple heuristic is choosing random points  as centroids and then proceed the algorithm.
The problem in this is the algo might get stuck in a local optimium.

So, a better solution is to choose a set of random points, calculate kmeans clusters and evaluate its effectiveness.

Just as Kmeans, GMM is also sensitive to initialization.
In GMM, there is a guarantee to find local optimum.
One heuristic is to run the kmeans algorithm and use that cluster as a initial paramters for GMM.
So, if Kmeans initialization is optimal, then GMM might also be optimal.
