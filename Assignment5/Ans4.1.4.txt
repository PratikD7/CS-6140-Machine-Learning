SSE algorithm calculates the sum of squared errors.
The errors are calculated as the Euclidean distance between a data point and a cluter centroid (mean).
Therefore, the SSE assumes a spherical radius of influence.

But in case of Gaussian Mixture models, however, the clusters are not necessarily spherical.
Therefore, SSE might not always be the best way to look at the quality of clustering.

On the other hand, the mutual information (MI) of two random variables is a measure of the mutual dependence between the two variables.
Therefore, the NMI can be use dto calcuate the clustering quality of any geometry.
